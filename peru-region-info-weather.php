									<p>The Region of Lima presents several climates but the most predominant one is an arid climate with a light drizzle from April to December and contradictorily with high levels of humidity (above 90%). </p>
									<p>June to September is usually overcast, and January to April is sunny but the days can start out overcast with high levels of humidity as well. </p>
									<p>The warmest month of the year is February (19°C to 29°) and the coldest is August (1°C to 19°C). </p>

									<p>In valleys located between 1,650 and 8,200 feet abover sea leve (500 and 2,500 m.a.s.l.), the climate is usually semi-dry and temperate; however as the altitude decreases, the rain also decreases but the humidity increases throughout the year (this is due to its proximity to the coastline, which brings very high levels of humidity). In this area the temperature decreases as altitude is gained with temperatures between 22°C and 10°C throughout the year. This type of climate is typical of the valleys in the Provinces of Barranca, Huaura, Huaral, Lima, and Cañete. </p>
									<p>In the Andean Mountains between 8,200 and 11,500 feet above sea level (2,500 and 3,500 m.a.s.l.), the climate is usually rainy from December to April (summer), dry from May to October, and throughout the year semi-frigid and humid. The temperature around midday can reach 15°C, but at night temperatures drop to 5°C or lower throughout the year. This climate is found in the Provinces of Cajatambo, Canta, Huaral, Huarochiri, Huaura, Oyon, and Yauyos. </p>
									<p>In the Andean Mountains above 11,500 feet above sea level (3,500 m.a.s.l.), the climate is frigid and dry throughout the year with heavy rain from October to May and a high chance of snow. Around midday temperatures can go as high as 13°C, but at night temperatures can drop below 0°C throughout the year.
