It is a mixture of Peruvian cultures and customs introduced by an increasing number of people emigrating in the 1970s and 1980s from the highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. This variety has also created a delicious cuisine recognized around the world, with two of its restaurants chosen among the 50 best restaurants in the world. Also, the head offices of the Executive, Judicial and Legislative branches of government are located in Lima Province or County. The Region of Lima has 10 provinces or counties and the most important one is Lima.
